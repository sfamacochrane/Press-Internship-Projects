# Press-Internship-Projects
Projects done for the Princeton University Press Digital Marketing Team, Summer 2020. 

**Book_scraping_PUP** file is code to crawl and scrape the PUP website for the url's of individual books. The url's can then be used to scrape for other information about the book (in this case, publication date).  

**Sales - Ads and Ideas Posts:** there is a PDF and an .rmd file. This project compared the number of books sold in a year with the click-through-rate, bounce rate, and other metrics for each book's ad campaign. I also looked at the relationship between units sold for books with and without an Ideas blog post about them, and analyzed whether the google analytics traffic on the blog post had any relationship to units sold.   

**Ideas**: This project compared several Google Analytics metrics for the Press's blog, "Ideas", based on the type of post. I scraped the Press website to determine whether each blog post was an essay, audio file, Book Club pick, exerpt, interview, video, or reading list, and then compared the boucne rates, pageviews, average time on page, and exit rates between the different blog post types.  

**Asset Types and Ad managers**: This project compared cost-per-click and click-through-rate for Facebook and Twitter ads, and compared the performance of ads with different asset types (links, images, videos). I also compared the perfomrance of ads based on the genre of the book (STEM, Humanities, Nature, and General Interest books).
